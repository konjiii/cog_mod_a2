# Materials for the Reinforcement Learning module of Cognitive Modelling


## Set-up:

We will use Python and Jupyter Notebooks during the workgroups. To get everything up and running:
- Download the notebooks. You can do this by pasting the link into https://downgit.github.io/ (if you haven't done so in the previous workgroup): Install Jupyter Notebooks in your favorite Python IDE (https://jupyter.org/install)
- Unzip the downloaded folder and open it in your Python IDE with Jupyter Notebooks installed
- Install any remaining packages that are not installed

You can also use Google Colab to access and run the Jupyter Notebooks without downloading anything. BUT make sure to save your progress!

Note that these are suggestions. If you have another way of running/editing a Jupyer Notebook, you are more than welcome to use that. Make sure however that you do run it in a way that, in the end, you can save your Jupyter notebook.

## Workgroups
1. During the workgroups you will have time to work on the challenges and questions of the jupyter notebook [(https://github.com/StevenM1/CM_RL/blob/main/CogMod24_bandit_student.ipynb)](https://github.com/StevenM1/CM_RL/blob/main/CogMod24_bandit_student.ipynb). Make sure to open the "student" notebook. The notebook roughly follows the first part of the lecture.
2. Once you have finished the challenges and questions, you can open the "solution" notebook [(https://github.com/StevenM1/CM_RL/blob/main/CogMod24_bandit_solution.ipynb)](https://github.com/StevenM1/CM_RL/blob/main/CogMod24_bandit_student.ipynb) and check if your answers were correct.
3. In the "solution" notebook you will find the three assignments. Make sure to reach at least 50 points (of 100).

## Handing-in

Submit an html of the "solution" notebook on Brighspace. The notebook should contain solutions for the assignments and subtasks in separate codes at the end of the notebook.
